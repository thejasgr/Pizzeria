            situations where they had to come up with wacky and fun excuses. The people with the best excuse won the

            Ever since we launched the Tastiest Pan Pizza, ever, people have not been able to resist the softest,
            cheesiest,
            crunchiest, butteriest Domino's Fresh Pan Pizza. They have been leaving the stage in the middle of a
            performance and even finding excuses to be
            disqualified in a football match.

            <p style="font-size:1.3vw"> We're ruthless about goodness. We have no qualms about tearing up a day-old
                lettuce
                leaf (straight from
                the farm), or steaming a baby (carrot). Cut. Cut. Chop. Chop. Steam. Steam. Stir.
                Stir. While they're still young and fresh - that's our motto. It makes the kitchen a better place.

                    spoons (among other things). They make goodness so good, it doesn't know what to do with itself.
